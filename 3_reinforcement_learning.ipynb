    "The inverted pendulum model is not just a toy model reproducing the properties of real robot models for balancing: as it turns out, the inverted pendulum appears in the dynamics of *any* mobile robot, that is, a model with a floating-base joint at the root of the kinematic tree. (If you are curious: the inverted pendulum is a limit case of the [Newton-Euler equations](https://scaron.info/robotics/newton-euler-equations.html) corresponding to floating-base coordinates in the equations of motion $M \\ddot{q} + h = S^T \\tau + J_c^T f$, in the limit where the robot [does not vary its angular momentum](https://scaron.info/robotics/point-mass-model.html).) Thus, while we work on a simplified inverted pendulum in this notebook, concepts and tools are those used as-is on real robots, as you can verify by exploring the bonus section.\n",
